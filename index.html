Time is an invention. It tells us where to be, how fast to go, when to arrive, how to get things done. Radisson Blu doesn’t understand time. It tells the clock to stand still. Makes the watch unnecessary. It is a moment to stop and discover.

Radisson Blu is packing up and wandering off the beaten path, because Radisson Blu is freedom. It’s pleasure. It’s taking a step back from responsibility, taking a break from the grind, finding a retreat that inspires the senses. Radisson Blu is connecting with nature. It is jogging along the beach with the wind in your face. It is the sound of the sea murmuring in your ear and saying: “Relax, take your time, enjoy the sun as it sets.”

Radisson Blu is a sense of play. It’s the discovery of a laugh, an embrace, the thrill of trying new things. It’s letting someone care for you just when you think you’ve forgotten what that means.

Radisson Blu is no worries. Not today.

Standing on the beach as the sun sinks over the horizon, the water turning a deep purple while the light crawls unhurriedly forward, that’s when time stops. That is the moment you’ll never forget.

Radisson Blu, because leisure is an art.
<br><br>
Kindly yours,
<br>
CEO of Radisson Blu
